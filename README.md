# Problem Statement
How can we use AI and BI based on categories like age, gender, lifestyle, and health to predict that a person has Alzheimers? 

# Context
Alzheimer’s Disease is one of the most common forms of dementia and affects millions of people worldwide. Detecting Alzheimer’s early in the process can improve quality of life and lead to better treatment. 

# Purpose
In this project, we will try to build a predictive model using data from 2,149 patients, which includes information about demographics, lifestyle, and clinical measurements. By applying data analysis and machine learning. We hope that we can predict some useful Alzheimer’s diagnosis based on these features. And who knows maybe one day we will crack the code? 

# Research Questions
- Can we predict the stage of Alzheimer’s disease using patient demographic and clinical data? 
- Which features are the most influential in disease progression? 
- Can we build a dashboard to visualize disease stages for clinical decision-making?

# Hypothesis
We expect that patients over the age of 80 have a higher risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease (over 60%), and that at least 50% of patients with a family history of Alzheimer’s also have the disease. Furthermore, we expect that only 10% of physically active patients aged 60–70 live longer than average compared to other diagnosed patients.

# Brief Annotation
### Which challenge would you like to address?
We would like to address the challenge of predicting the stage of Alzheimer’s using patient demographic and clinical data, such as age, gender, health, history and clinical results. 

### Why is this challenge an important or interesting research goal?
It is important because understanding the stage of the disease early can help the doctors give the right treatment at the right time, before it is too late. It can also improve patients' quality of life and slow down the disease. 

### What is the expected solution your project would provide?
Our solution will include a machine learning model that predicts the disease stage and a simple dashboard to show the results in a clear and useful way. 

### What would be the positive impact of the solution, which category of users could benefit from it?
As explained before, the solution could help doctors and healthcare staff make faster and more informed decisions. It can also be used in hospitals or clinics to support better care for Alzhimer’s patients.
